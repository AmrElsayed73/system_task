#First I setup the  deployment for AWS agent in my working Directory 

   terraform init
   
#Then I am going to make creation for EC2 on AWS with AMI id and security group defined for this instance , after that i will make installation for  docker on this instance,
and pull the Rocket.chat image that given and making a connection with the mango DB as required .

Here is the Terraform file that i created to setup the Resources required
